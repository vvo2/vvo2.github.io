### How I develop my whole brain:
I put all my time during college but my academic did not match, which left me curious so I had to troubleshoot my physical and mental health. so I made use of my engineering background and applied when i fix or update things, and that lead to innovation and research that extended to more skills learned and various other useful knowledge. I then realize education is a habit along with my own research and development. If I'm capable of learn a particular subject then I will learn it.


### What Why How
My name is Vuong Vo, I'm a future software developer(hopefully), with engineering background and a wide variety of education because different area of education can relate to one another, increase logic and mental strategy, method and theories can transfer and evolve into something better or a new discovery. I believe any average person can be smart, stay physically and mentally healthy and give them the "start" to drive into a bright future.

| Why       | How       | what     |
| --------- |:---------:| --------:|
| Time Saving Products | Coding Skills | Innovated products |
| Networking | Ideas for activities | Shows and Events |

### Elevator Pitch
Learning trade skills and other useful knowledge was my alternative around an engineering degree. Then I put the strategy I learned in mental health to improve my learning capability. I want to apply coding toward my various education, technical, and engineering background to innovate products.

Weekly Reflections:    
First week seems like the longest week, Thursday came by and Donny quietly drop out leaving 7 students remaining.

Second week, some confusion had clear up, but we're all still lingering in the abyss. By Wednesday, as we're all being interrogatated, we lost Matt as he concludes that he is totally lost; 6 students remaining. 

Third week, losing one student per week feels like a TV game show with elimination round every week...
