### Worth Questions
1.  The internal factor is my level of knowledge & skill in Java will set my worth.  The external factor is the city of my career will limit my desire salary.
2.  I will create value for other with my creativity and innovative ideas, if skill level is not not an issue.
3.  I been told I have potential, although I also been told I'm a little off. My family, friends, and colleagues (civilian and military) believe I am smart, some call it multi-talented, some see me a successor (but not as rich millionaire), because I learning on my own along with the research and development of things not yet in the market. Colleges does not see me as a potential as for my poor academic, plus ADHD and read.  I believe in both side but I continue education regardless. 

### Salary Expectation
1.  Salary, start of with simple almost free apps, then I don't mind starting around 40k I think 60k is fine for a few year experience level.  I will not live in state with high living cost like Cali and New York, I prefer to bring money back into smaller city like Albuquerque.
