### How I develop my whole brain:
I put all my time during college but my academic did not match which left me curious so I had to troubleshoot my physical and mental health. so I made use of my engineering background and applied when i fix or update things, and that lead to innovation and research that extended to learn more skills and various other useful knowledge without realizing learning a habit with my own research and development. If I'm capable of learn a particular subject then I will learn it.


### What Why How

### Elevator Pitch


Weekly Reflections:
Week 1
First week seems like the longest week, Thursday came by and Donny quietly drop out leaving 7 students remaining.

Week 2
Some confusion had clear up, but we're all still lingering in the abyss. By Wednesday, as we're all being interrogatated, we lost Matt as he concludes that he is totally lost; 6 students remaining. 

week 3
Losing one student per week feels like a TV game show with elimination round every week...
