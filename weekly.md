### Weekly Reflections:   

**Sixth Week**: Android Session with Google search API gotten way out of scoop, we couldn't learn much from that, so I think the students need to know more than the basics prior to bootcamp, like briefly learn almost the entire java then get in the meat and detail in class. and learning how things being invoke and pass around in java will save alot of bootcamp time. The *Big Nerd Ranch Android Programming* is a difficult to learn book. Regardless if the code instruction is incomplete with useless diagrams, this book does not compliant with learning techniques and theories that a neurologist and psychologist recommend.

**Fifth Week**: Our professor Nick teaches with some learning strategy that I'd never seen in my college years, He call it doggy pedal with a shark behind our tail, an example is throwing advance foreign code in the exam. After getting pass the emotions, I believe this encourage us to study harder, look closer, and dive deeper.  Thinking back on those youtube java videos i watched, it lack the detailed explanation, and it is too fast, making it hard for the brain to remember, therefore those java video are only good for reviews.

**Fouth Week**: Our first exam was super hard, there were codes we never seen before, Christ said it's harder than last cohor and this was part of a learning strategy. We dont have enought pratice writting code so syntax error slow us down. Jac & Donny did most of the coding, they ask questions faster than i could accumulate words in my head.  I think every student should be require to read the simpilfied Java textbook prior to bootcamp. [Head First Java](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjava/) is one of few.

**Third week**: losing one student per week feels like a TV game show with elimination round every week; best of luck to Freddy.  I feel like pre-work prior to bootcamp was not enought to prepare most student.

**Second week**, some confusion had clear up, but we're all still lingering in the abyss. By Wednesday, as we're all being interrogated, we lost Matt as he concludes that he is totally lost; 6 students remaining. 

**First week** seems like the longest week, Thursday came by and Donny quietly drop out leaving 7 students remaining.
