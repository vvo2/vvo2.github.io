### Weekly Reflections:   

**Fouth Week**: Our first exam was super hard, there were codes we never seen before, Christ said it's harder than last cohor and this was part of a learning strategy. We dont have enought pratice writting code so syntax error slow us down. Jac & Donny did most of the coding, they ask questions faster than i could accumulate words in my head.  I think every student should be require to read the simpilfied Java textbook prior to bootcamp. [Head First Java](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjava/) is one of few.

**Third week**: losing one student per week feels like a TV game show with elimination round every week; best of luck to Freddy.  I feel like pre-work prior to bootcamp was not enought to prepare most student.

**Second week**, some confusion had clear up, but we're all still lingering in the abyss. By Wednesday, as we're all being interrogated, we lost Matt as he concludes that he is totally lost; 6 students remaining. 

**First week** seems like the longest week, Thursday came by and Donny quietly drop out leaving 7 students remaining.
